## Title in Markdown

Creating a title in Markdown is simple. Use the `#` symbol followed by a space and your title text. The number of `#` symbols determines the level of the heading.

## Different Types of Headings

Here are examples of different heading levels:

### Heading Level 3

#### Heading Level 4

##### Heading Level 5

## Writing a Paragraph

To write a paragraph in Markdown, just start typing your text. Ensure you leave a blank line above and below your paragraph for proper formatting.

Example: 

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus lacinia odio vitae vestibulum vestibulum. Cras venenatis euismod malesuada.

## Creating a Table

Tables are a great way to organize information. Here’s an example of a Markdown table:

| Column - 1           | Column 2 |
| -------------- | --- |
| hello         | world |

## Code Cell Example

Jupyter Notebooks support embedding code cells that allow you to execute code within the notebook. Here’s a simple example in Python:

```python
print("Hello World!")
